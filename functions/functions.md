# Functions
In Programming, code is mostly used to perform a task multiple times. Instead of repeating the same code more than once, we can create a block of code to perform the same task. 

This is where a function comes in handy. A function is reusable, it groups statements to perform a task. This makes writing code easier and clearer.
